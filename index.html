<h1> This is Janna Carmona from 9-Family. </h1>
<p> My name is Lady Janna E. Carmona, Also known as 'Janna' or 'LJ', and this is my <b/>Quarter 2 S.Y.2024-2025 TLE-ICT E-portfolio</b/>. Get to know me better in my grade 9 years!
<br/> <br/>
My current quarters shedule has been hectic, with many events and newer performance tasks. But all and all it has been just as great as it was last quarter
<br/> <br/>
In this quarter in ICT-TLE, I have been more comfortable with Mrs. Uminga. My favourite interaction with her this quarter was her telling me to leave the PISA review because my 16th birthday is on January 6, and the PISA is only for 15 year olds! Funny but reminded me that I'm getting older.
<br/> <br/>
My grades are somewhat still not that great.. I do hope to get better. My activities are mostly rushed, And I'm not sure how to use float yet. But I will learn eventually!
<br/> <br/>
I have learned many things new about HTML, and with the newly learned CSS! A bit hard to wrap around to, but I'm warming up to it.
